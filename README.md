the Bad Hashing Algorithm in Python

Not bad as in malicious, but just bad...

Written in Python an interpreter language it runs magnitudes slower that your average Hashing Algorithm.
For now, it can only process utf-8 encoded characters that are thrown at it from stdin.
But hey...

It algorithms hashes!
